# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) vs Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)
GUI's are more intuitive and user friendly.

CLI's are:
- Arguably faster.
- Can run commands sequentially in batches.
- Is easier to implement changes to and call functions from.
- Call scripts for automation.

# Scripts (Interpreted Languages) vs Programs (Compiled Languages) 
Scripting Language = Interpreted Language. 
Programming Language = Compiled Language.  

Advantages of scripts:
- Fast to edit.
- Generally easier to learn.

Disadvantages of scripts:
- Slower to run.
- Requires an intepreter to run (i.e. a browser for JavaScript).
