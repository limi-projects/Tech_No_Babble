# The Internet

## Web Browsers
The user inputs a web address which the browser interprets and uses to request the relevant data (.html files) from the web server.

When designing web pages it is a good idea to test each web page with as many different browsers and intefaces as possible, to ensure that formatting is preserved.  

## File Transfer Protocols
Web content may be uploaded to web servers via the _File Transfer Protocol_ (FTP). An FTP client is often used to conveniently maneuver files using the FTP. An example FTP client is FIleZilla.
