# Chemistry
Often regarded as "the central science", the study of chemistry overlaps with a number of disciplines including, but not limited to biology, physics, mathematics and electrical engineering. It focuses on the study of matter; how and why substances interact with their environment. 
The rules that govern chemical processes often change substantially depending on the state (solid, liquid, gas) of the matter in question. As such, concepts are subdivided according to these states.

# The Atom
The atom is a foundational concept for chemistry.
| 

## General Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Hartree-Fock Theory | Finding an approximate solutions to the Schrodinger Equation to estimate the properties of matter. |
| Density Functional Theory | Reinterpreting the Schrodinger Equation to generate solutions faster than Hartree-Fock Theory. |

## The Solid State
Atoms are held closely together to for a tangible shape and volume.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Close packing | Using hard spheres to model the arrangement of crystal structures. |
| [Special Quasi-Random Structures](sqs.md) | Using sufficently randomised crystal stuctures to estimate the properties of alloys. |

## The Liquid State


| Concept | Description |
|---|---|

## The Gas State

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|

## Overlapping State Concepts
Concepts that involve traversing 

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Phase Diagrams | How each state is traversed as a function of temperature and pressure. |


| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Interfaces | Studying the phenomena at the interface between different states. |
| Heterogeneity | Studying the phenomena when two states are used together. |
