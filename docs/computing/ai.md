# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
For the most part, contemporary AI involves the application of _Machine Learning_.
Examples of applied AI include:
- Generative AI
- Computer Vision
- Speech
- Natural Language Processing
- Data Extraction.

_Multi-modal_ models combine multiple AI components (e.g. computer vision + generative AI).

## Generative AI
This involves using AI to create forms of media. 
Language AI models understand and exploit semantic relationships between language elements. 
Language AI models can be subdivided into:
- _Small language models_: Small amount of data. Cheap to train and use. Less generalisable.
- _Large language models_: Large amount of data. Costly to train and use. More generalisable.

Applications include:
- Customer service chatbots.
- Document generation.
- Translations.
- Summarising text.

## Computer Vision
This involves identifying facets and motifs within images:
- _Image classification_: identify and categorise an image.
- _Object detection_: finding a particular object within an image.
  
_Semantic segmentation_ is a more advanced form of computer vision that involves assigning each pixel in an image to a class. 
This allows for more fine-grained identifications.

Applications include:
- Extracting facets from images.
- Visual searches.
- Monitoring retail stock.
- Security video
- Facial recognition
- Automated Robotics
- Optical character recognition.

## Speech
_Speech Recognition_ involves interpreting speech. E.g. speech-to-text.
_Speech Synthesis_ involves producing speech. E.g. text-to-speech.

Applications include:
- AI assistants.
- Automated transcription.
- Automated description.
- Automated translation.

## Natural Language Processing / Understanding (NLP/NLU)
This involves fulfilling particular objectives within text analysis. Examples include:
- Entity extraction: Identifying text entities (people, objects, places, etc.).
- Text classification: Assigning text to a category based on its content.
- Sentiment analysis: Inferring tone and opinions from text.
- Language detection: Identifying the language of the text.

Applications include:
- Extracting particular facets from text.
- Evaluating consensus from multiple sources (E.g. social media).
- Implementing simplified chatbots without generative AI (e.g. an automatic FAQ redirecter).

## Data Extraction
This involves extracting information from another entity (e.g. text from an image, voices from a recording) and interpreting that information.

Applications include:
- Automating form processing.
- Large-scale digitalisation of paper information.
- Indexing searchable docs
- Summarising text and recordings.

## Drawbacks
- Inductive reasoning: due to the probabilistic nature of AI's outputs and its reliance on training data, it may suffer from issues associated with inductive reasoning (concluding based on probabilities rather than certainties), such as the turkey illusion.
- Hallucinations: Due to their probabilistic nature, AI outputs are also prone to hallucinations, wherein the AI will reach an incorrect conclusion but will be overly assertive in presenting that conclusion as correct.

### Ethics
There are ethical concerns associated with AI, including:
- Intentionally or unintentionally inserting biases into AI outputs, based on the training data that is used.
- Possible violations of intellectual property rights and privacy rights, depending on how the training data was gathered and used.
- Overreliance on AI tools, leading to quantity-over-quality approaches.

Microsoft's ethos on responsible AI use:
- Fair: Humans select and source training data. Bias, unconscious or otherwise, is mentioned as a concern.
- Reliable and Safe: AI is based on probabilistic models, which may fail.
- Privacy and Security: Training data often includes personal information, which raises security concerns.
- Inclusiveness: Aiming to avoid exclusion.
- Accountability: AI authors are held accountable for their work, including deficiencies in their models.
