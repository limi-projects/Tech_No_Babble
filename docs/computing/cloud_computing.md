# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing uses the inernet to deliver computer services such as virtual machines, stroage, databases, networks, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and AI.

The advantages are that you do not need to and manage the physical hardware and infratructure to run your business. You can simply "rent" more resources from the provider if your business needs expand and vice versa.

## The Shared Responsibility Model
The provider is responsible for maintaining the majority of the computing resources, such as the hardware and networking. 
The user of the reources is responsible for the data that they are using, the deivdes being used (i.e. computers) as well as the account access security (login creadntials, etc.). 

This relationship is more nuanced in relation to virtual machines. 
The user is responsible for managing resources that they have created inside a virtual machine. If the same resources were requested outside of a virtual machine, then the provider would be responsible for their maintenance.

The degree to which the user and provider are responsible for different resources also depends on the _type_ of cloud service. These types include:
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): The consumer is responsible for everything except for physcial security, power and connectivity.  
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): The user is responsible for data, devices and accounts, and may share some more infrastructure related responsibiliies.
- SaaS (Software as a Service): The user is responsible for data, devices and accounts. The provider is responsible for most, if not all of the computing infrastructure.

## Cloud Models
The Cloud Model determines how the user interacts with the cloud computing platform. Such models include:
- Private: Only the business can intract with the cloud resources.
- Public: Anyone can interact the cloud resources.
- Hybrid: Select resorces can be isolated and held privately/publicly at the user's discretion.

Private models are considered to be be more secure but costly. The opposite is true for publi models.

Multi-cloud models: Cloud resources are sourced from more than one provider (e.g. Microsft Azure and AWS).

## Consumption Based Model
IT infrastructure incurs two kinds of expenses:
- CapEx (Capital Expenditure): A one-time expense for a tangible reosource (i.e. hardware) "Buying"
- OpEx (Operational Expenditure): A recurring service charge (i.e. cloud services) "Renting".

Cloud computing is classed as OpEx because you are renting the computational hardware, not buying it.
The A Consuption Model takes persoanl usage into account when charging. The more computing resources you use, the more you are charged.

It is argued that cloud infrastructure may save costs when compared to CapEx investment, as the resource usage costs can be more flexibly adjusted as the business' needs change.
