# Microsoft Power BI
Power BI is used for developing reports and analyses.
It comprises three components:
- Desktop Application: For report creation and management.
- Online Service Platform: For report sharing and management between users.
- Mobile Application: For mobile-optimised viewing and management of reports.

Power BI utilises semantic models and visualisations.

Semantic models maintain the relationships between data and visualisations, and are convenient representations for the interpretation of said data.

Power BI emphasises low-code to generate reports and analyses quickly.
